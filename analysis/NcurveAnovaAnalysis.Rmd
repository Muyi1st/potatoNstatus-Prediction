# Assuming you have:
# - 'data' as your phenotypic dataset with columns: Response, Variety, NitrogenRate, and Replication
# - 'markers' as the marker matrix with rows as varieties and columns as markers

# Step 1: Prepare Phenotypic Data
data$Variety <- as.factor(data$Variety)
data$NitrogenRate <- as.factor(data$NitrogenRate)
data$Replication <- as.factor(data$Replication)

# Make sure that the rows in 'markers' match the varieties in 'data' by their IDs
# 'markers' should be a matrix with rows = varieties and columns = genetic markers
rownames(markers) <- levels(data$Variety)  # Set row names to match variety names in data

# Step 3: Calculate the Genomic Relationship Matrix (GRM)
# GRM is calculated as: G = MM' / m where M is the marker matrix and m is the number of markers
